# Copypasta

> A Chrome extension that stores text clippings for you to easily copy and paste!

Type in your text clipping and now you can copy it from any tab with a single click.

The data is saved to localStorage, which supposedly holds up to 5MB, so there’s plenty of room for actual copypastas. I tried it with the bee movie script and it works fine, although it’s a bit of a hassle to scroll through all of it to reach the bottom ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### You can use it for:

- Food orders
- Text emoticons
- Addresses
- Email / phone numbers
- Macaron recipes
- Code snippets?
- Copy pastas
